    %h2 Welcome to the New LE!
    %p The Team has been working hard for many months to bring you a new, improved and faster LE. We hope you like it and as always we rely on your feedback for even more improvements and features.

    %p In addition to our new spokespig, Sir Bacon Francis, PhD., “BUCKS” have now become “Credits”. We hope this will allow you to print more per page and stop confusing students that a Buck should be worth at US Dollar. Sir Bacon will still honor older printed and e-Buck codes though so don’t worry!
